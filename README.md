# selector-multiple-tui-add-remove-modify
A suxy keyboard key press navigable read operated TUI framework which creates selection menus. This can be used to create things such as menu-driven step-by-step scripts or single and multiple select from options scripts. Runs as a standalone "package" but can also be sourced if desired under most shells such as Bash, Zsh, or Fish.
